My favorite vim commands
========================

1. To change all the existing tab characters to match the current tab settings, use: `:retab`

2. `dt)` and `ct)`, for example, are variants on `di)` and `ci)` that delete from the cursor
position to the matching paren. `da)` and `ca)` delete everything inside the matching )
including the ) itself.
